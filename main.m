% Based on the theory developed in "Highway Traffic Control via Smart

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% Preliminaries
% The data on traffic flows in the netherlands are obtained from
% https://dexter.ndwcloud.nu/home
% The user is assumed to select the the sensors and then dave a .cvs data.
% This has to be saved in the folder '>fnc>data_reader>traffic_data'
% The details on the data used in this example can be found in details in
% the papaer "Highway Traffic Control via Smart
% e-Mobility - Part II : Case Study"


%% 1. Data extraction
% Extract the data about traffic from the file 'intensiteit-snelheid-export' stored in
% the folder: >fnc>data_reader>traffic_data

% plot the data obtained graphs
opt_DATEX.display = 1;

opt_DATEX.path = 'C:\A_Tesi\CTM-identification\fnc\data_reader\extracted_data';
%opt_DATEX.path = 'C:/Users/adria/Documents/Uni/LM II anno/Tesi/CTM-identification/fnc/data_reader/extracted_data/';
%opt_DATEX.path = 'H:\Il mio Drive\Tesi magistrale\CTM-identification\fnc\data_reader\extracted_data';

% minimum frequency per minute at which you want the
% data. Performs an interpolation if the data are
% sampled at a lower rate
opt_DATEX.min_freq = 6;

% extract the data from 'intensiteit-snelheid-export' and save the result in
% 'data_structure4_v2' and store it in the structure data
data = csv_DATEX_reader_v5('intensiteit-snelheid-export','data_structure4_v2',opt_DATEX);

%% 2. CTM param identification
% Identify the parameters of the CTM model
% and the input flow 'phi_1'

% plot the figures realtive to the CTM identification, mainly the
% fundamental diagram
opt_identification.disp = 1;


% threshold below which the vehicles are assumed to be into a congestion.
% This was tuned for the problem at hand by looking at the plots attained
% in 'cvs_DATEX_reader' regarding the velocity.

opt_identification.speed_th = [80 85 90 90 90 90 ...
                               90 95 90 90 85 78];


% The threshold used in the quantile regression, these are tuned for the
% particular date used in this example. The vector has to be as long as the
% number of cells in teh CTM model.

opt_identification.coeff_quantile = [0.90 0.95 0.95 0.90 0.90 0.90 ...
                                     0.95 0.90 0.95 0.90 0.90 0.95];


[CTM_param,phi_1] = CTM_identification(data,opt_identification);
